# Blazor Extensions

Blazor Extensions is a set of packages with the goal of adding useful features to [Blazor](https://blazor.net).

# Blazor Extensions SignalR

This package adds a [Microsoft ASP.NET Core SignalR](https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR) client library for [Microsoft ASP.NET Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor).

The package aims to mimic the C# APIs of SignalR Client as much as possible and it is developed by wrapping the TypeScript client by using Blazor's interop capabilities. 

For more information about SignalR development, please check [SignalR documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction?view=aspnetcore-2.1).

# Features

This package implements all public features of SignalR Typescript client.

> Note: The _Streaming_ APIs are not implemented yet. We will add it soon.

# Sample usage

The following snippet shows how to setup the client to send and receive messages using SignalR.

The HubConnectionBuilder needs to get injected, which must be registered:
```c#
// in Startup.cs, ConfigureServices()
   services.AddTransient<HubConnectionBuilder>();
```
```c#
// in Component class
[Inject]
private HubConnectionBuilder _hubConnectionBuilder { get; set; }
```
```c#
// in Component Initialization code
var connection = _hubConnectionBuilder // the injected one from above.
        .WithUrl("/myHub", // The hub URL. If the Hub is hosted on the server where the blazor is hosted, you can just use the relative path.
        opt =>
        {
            opt.LogLevel = SignalRLogLevel.Trace; // Client log level
            opt.Transport = HttpTransportType.WebSockets; // Which transport you want to use for this connection
        })
        .Build(); // Build the HubConnection

connection.On("Receive", this.Handle); // Subscribe to messages sent from the Hub to the "Receive" method by passing a handle (Func<object, Task>) to process messages.
await connection.StartAsync(); // Start the connection.

await connection.InvokeAsync("ServerMethod", param1, param2, paramX); // Invoke a method on the server called "ServerMethod" and pass parameters to it. 

var result = await connection.InvokeAsync<MyResult>("ServerMethod", param1, param2, paramX); // Invoke a method on the server called "ServerMethod", pass parameters to it and get the result back.
```
